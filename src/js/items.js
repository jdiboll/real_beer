This was the favorite transportation of the late 60s for the &quot;hippies&quot; because they could carry a lot of people, they got good mileage, simple to work on and were cheap to buy. If you are part of the &quot;woodstock generation&quot; or just like old VWs then you need this mug.\r\n\r\nEach one of my beer mugs are handmade one at a time as they are ordered so each one will be just a little bit different in shading but the design will always be the same as shown. These are sand blasted, not acid or cream etched and are 100% safe for the dishwasher and will go in the freezer well also.\r\n\r\n  This is a large mug at 7\u201d tall by 3 \u00bd\u201d in diameter and will hold 2-12 ounce cans of your favorite beverages. I call it a beer mug but you can fill it with lemon aid or iced tea if you prefer.\r\n\r\n This mug can be had in multiple amounts also. Just ask. Shipping seems like a lot but it weighs almost 3 pounds.\r\n\r\n  I really enjoy designing these so there will be more designs coming so check back often. I also do custom one off designs so if you would like something special please let me know.\r\n\r\nShipping quoted is to the lower 48 states.

The Basement cannot be responsible for damaged or lost packages (ie - we will not grant refunds on lost or missing items without purchasing insurance first). The postal receipt will serve as confirmation of shipping, but please contact us prior to purchasing or in the notes when ordering if you&#39;d like to purchase insurance on your items.\r\n\r\n\u25ba Your order will actually be marked as shipped when we pull them for processing (unfortunately - that&#39;s the only way we can mark them as pulled through the Etsy system) but it will NOT actually be shipped until you receive the email with the tracking number. If you don&#39;t see the tracking number on your receipt or in an email in about 5 biz days after your order has been placed, feel free to convo me for it!\r\n\r\n\u25ba**INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING**\u25c4 (IE. out of the United States) Please read *all* of the information below in our Shipping Policy regarding time line, tracking and potential duty fees BEFORE ordering. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately shipping out of the States first class can be very slow. For no apparent reason, packages can take upwards of three weeks to arrive and do not include any sort of detailed tracking information - the tracking will end when the package leaves the states and often there will not be any tracking at all. So, if you want your package faster or would prefer full tracking, I can offer you guaranteed international shipping, but it will start at $30. Please convo me FIRST if you&#39;d like to receive an international package in 10 days or less, otherwise, please know, international packages can take anywhere from 1-4 weeks and they are not automatically insured. This means unless you upgrade the shipping from first class, you are assuming responsibility for the shipping. In order for us to ship internationally, we cannot be held responsible for packages lost in transit without the buyer purchasing insurance first as we have no way of tracking or tracing first class international mail. \r\n\r\nIn addition, you may also be responsible for any duty charges \/ VAT taxes imposed by your country on incoming packages from the US (especially in the UK for some reason). We do not code customs as gifts and we will not do so, so there may be applicable duty charges imposed by your country and beyond our control. By completing your purchase you agree to be responsible for these charges (they will typically range from $5-20USD depending on your order total) If you are unsure of your potential duty charges, please check with your local post BEFORE ordering as we will not be responsible for these charges or refund the duty charges back. \r\n\r\nPer the Government of the UK Trade Tariff:\r\nImporting from outside the EU is subject to a third country duty of 12.00 %.\r\nGoods are subject to VAT standard rate.\r\nGoods are subject to VAT zero rate.\r\n\r\nSorry about this, but we just don&#39;t have the capability to cover these charges on international orders with the type of products we sell. :( We love our international customers, but really want you to understand that specifically in the UK you may have to pay more to get your special Basement creation - Canada does not typically impose incoming duty charges.","policy_refunds":"We typically only accept refunds or exchanges on damaged goods.

Everything - wording, colors, names can all be set to your desired look. Simply include instructions in the message to seller section.\r\n\r\n\u25ba How do your shirts run?\r\nOur plain T-shirts run true to size now, probably even on the larger side. There is usually no need order up. The raglan shirts are a slim cut fit, but run fairly true to size, you can usually get away with ordering up on almost all sizes - the raglans only come in even sizes though - 2\/4\/6\/8\/10 \r\n\r\n\u25ba Do you do proofs on customizations \/ order changes?\r\nSorry, but with the volume of orders and custom requests I receive, in order to keep my prices low and turnaround time on target, I simply cannot do proofs on regular and basic order changes and customizations. Rest assured, you&#39;re in good hands and of course if I make a mistake I will correct it! :) Thanks for your understanding!!\r\n\r\n\u25ba Are your shirts sublimation or iron-on?\r\nNeither! (usually - we do some sublimating for dark products and coffee mugs) What that means is that we use a cutting edge digital printing machine that actually dies the fabric. This means the fabric is not scratchy, won&#39;t crack or fade and retains the soft feel for many many washings. Some slight washing fade will occur like most t-shirts, but, if you&#39;re not sure - read our feedback, we think that speaks for itself!\r\n\r\n\u25ba Will I love these shirts?\r\nWe think so, but don&#39;t just take our word for it - read our feedback and see what everyone has to say! We hope you&#39;ll choose our site for creating your family t-shirt memories! :)\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT OTHER THINGAMABOBBERS:\r\n\r\n** Not all monitors are created equal... like.. at all! So, please keep this in mind that actual shirt colors will look different from monitor to monitor and vary in brightness and tone as it&#39;s impossible to show the exact shade on every monitor \/ device!\r\n\r\n** Not all dyes are created equal! We use a couple different manufacturers for our shirts and while the styles are similar, occasionally the dye lots will vary slightly so you may have some color variations if you order a group of raglans that include some infant \/ some toddler \/some youth shirts. If this is a problem, please contact me before ordering so I can make sure I can get you an exact color match!\r\n\r\n*** Koozies use a full color sublimation process to get the full vibrant colors, however in sublimation you will find some small areas of white are left on the seams on bottom as it is just a limitation of the sublimation process itself. The areas of small discoloration and white are very common and a part of the sublimation print process itself.\r\n\r\n************************************************************************************\r\nLayouts are all custom created by the Basement.   Hey other shop owners - let&#39;s all think of our own ideas, kay? It makes me super sad when you take my original concepts\/ideas and change them just enough... :( I respect others original ideas, so let&#39;s just all do the same and we&#39;ll get along great here!","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1454962421,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/zbasement?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/057\/0\/10650288\/iusb_760x100.15354888_5r7o.jpg","num_favorers":245,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null,"is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":271508075,"state":"active","user_id":42202722,"category_id":68889876,"title":"St Patrick&#39;s Day Lucky Shamrock Shirt.
